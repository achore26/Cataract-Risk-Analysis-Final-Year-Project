üìå Project Vision and Background: Bridging the Gap in Eye Care
This project is more than just a piece of code‚Äîit's a step towards addressing a significant public health issue.

The Problem: According to the World Health Organization, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, accounting for nearly 51% of global blindness cases. In countries like Kenya, many individuals, particularly in remote regions, do not seek medical attention until the condition has significantly worsened. This is primarily due to a lack of awareness, financial constraints, and an extremely low ratio of ophthalmologists to the general population. This leads to delayed treatment and, often, avoidable blindness. The existing healthcare infrastructure, especially in rural and underserved areas, struggles to provide widespread, early screening.

The Solution: This project aims to bridge that gap by creating an accessible, web-based tool for preliminary cataract risk assessment. The system allows users to upload images of their eyes through a simple website. These images are then analyzed using a trained deep learning model to check for early signs of cataracts. The system's goal is to provide a preliminary risk assessment that encourages high-risk individuals to seek professional medical help early enough for proper treatment.

Our Goal: To use modern, accessible digital technology to empower individuals, particularly in underserved areas, to take control of their eye health. The system is designed to be a simple and convenient first-line screening tool, supporting global efforts to reduce preventable blindness in a scalable way.

‚ú® Key Features
User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality via a web interface.

Image Upload Interface: A user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface for uploading eye images (JPG/PNG).

Real-time Risk Prediction: An integrated deep learning model analyzes the uploaded image to provide a cataract risk classification.

Intuitive Results: The system displays a clear result (Low Risk, Moderate Risk, or High Risk) along with a confidence score.

Actionable Recommendations: Provides text-based recommendations and next steps based on the risk level.

Responsive Design: The application is fully compatible with both mobile phones and desktop browsers.

Admin Dashboard (Optional): An administrative view for monitoring system usage, user activity, and prediction logs.

üìö Project Methodology and Research
2.0 Literature Review
This project is built on a foundation of existing academic research in the field of AI-driven medical imaging. The literature review was crucial for understanding the state-of-the-art in ophthalmology diagnostics and identifying a critical research gap.

Theoretical Framework: The system draws upon key theories from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Specifically, it uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, Supervised Learning to train models on labeled datasets, and Transfer Learning to fine-tune pre-trained models.

Image Processing: The system uses techniques like Histogram Equalization to enhance image contrast and Gaussian Filtering to reduce noise, ensuring the images are optimized for the deep learning model.

Research Gaps: The review highlighted a lack of research on AI-driven cataract risk assessment specifically in the Kenyan context, as well as challenges with dataset diversity and model generalizability. This project is a direct effort to address these gaps by creating a localized, accessible, and effective screening tool.

Critique of Existing Work: A comparative analysis of existing studies was performed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques, datasets, and methodologies, informing the development choices for this project.

üß™ System Testing and Validation
The project was rigorously tested to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements. The testing phase focused on validating the system's correctness, performance, security, and usability.

Unit and Integration Testing: We conducted a total of 48 unit tests and 12 integration tests to verify the correctness of individual functions and end-to-end user flows. All critical scenarios passed, and an edge case related to corrupted image handling was successfully fixed.

Performance Testing: Using simulated load, the system demonstrated a median prediction latency of approximately 3.2 seconds. Under a simulated load of 100 concurrent users, the 95th percentile latency was approximately 9.8 seconds, meeting the non-functional requirement of providing results in less than 10 seconds.

Usability Testing: A pilot usability study with 6 participants yielded a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of ‚â•70, indicating good usability. Feedback from this phase led to minor interface improvements, such as clearer button labels and help text.

Security Validation: Automated security scans and a static code review were performed. This led to improvements in file upload sanitization and other security measures.

Future Deployment: The codebase has been prepared for a secure cloud deployment, with sensitive information like model weights and API keys externalized to ensure they are not committed to the repository.

üöß Limitations and Future Work
This section highlights the current limitations and offers recommendations for future development to enhance the system's capabilities and robustness.

Model Generalizability: The current model's accuracy and generalizability could be improved with a larger, more diverse dataset, especially one that is representative of different regions and demographics in Kenya.

Clinical Validation: A critical next step is to conduct a prospective clinical study where the model's predictions are compared against professional ophthalmologist diagnoses to validate its effectiveness in a real-world setting.

Production Hardening: For a full-scale public launch, the system should be deployed in a containerized environment with advanced security measures like rate limiting and strict upload sanitization rules to prevent malicious use. Rate limiting is a control mechanism used to manage network traffic to prevent users from exhausting system resources and mitigate attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Continuous Improvement: We recommend implementing a system for periodic model retraining with new, anonymized data to continuously improve its accuracy and adapt to new insights.
